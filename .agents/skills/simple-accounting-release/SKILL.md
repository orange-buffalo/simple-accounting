# Simple Accounting Release Skill

Use this skill when the user wants to create a new Simple Accounting release, draft a GitHub release, publish release notes, or run the local release workflow.

This skill intentionally performs all repository-writing release operations locally. CI must not create tags or GitHub releases; CI only publishes the Docker image when it sees a release version on `master`.

## Preconditions

Run these checks before changing anything:

```bash
gh auth status
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner,url
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree
git branch --show-current
git status --short
git fetch origin master --tags
```

Stop immediately if any condition is not met:

- `gh auth status` must show an authenticated GitHub CLI session.
- The current branch must be exactly `master`; releases are only supported from the main branch.
- The working copy must be clean, including no staged changes and no untracked files.
- `origin/master` must exist and be reachable.

After fetching, verify local `master` is current:

```bash
git status --branch --short
git rev-parse HEAD
git rev-parse origin/master
```

If `HEAD` differs from `origin/master`, stop and ask the user whether to pull, push, or abort. Do not release from a branch that is behind or ahead without explicit user approval.

## Release Workflow

Execute these steps in order. Report command failures verbatim and stop unless the remediation is explicitly listed.

### 1. Capture the Previous GitHub Release

Use GitHub releases as the source of the previously published version:

```bash
previous_release_json="$(gh release view --json tagName,name,url,createdAt,isDraft,isPrerelease 2>/dev/null || true)"
previous_tag="$(gh release view --json tagName --jq .tagName 2>/dev/null || true)"
previous_release_url="$(gh release view --json url --jq .url 2>/dev/null || true)"
```

If no GitHub release exists, fall back to the latest remote version tag:

```bash
if [[ -z "$previous_tag" ]]; then
  previous_tag="$(git tag --list 'v[0-9]*.[0-9]*.[0-9]*' --sort=-version:refname | head -n 1)"
fi
```

Rules:

- Prefer `gh release view` over git tags because the report must reference the latest GitHub release.
- Use the previous release tag as the exclusive lower bound for commit collection.
- If there is no previous GitHub release and no previous version tag, use the first repository commit as the lower bound and say this is the first release.
- Preserve the tag exactly as GitHub reports it, usually `vX.Y.Z`.

### 2. Create the Release Commit and Tag

Run the semver plugin release task:

```bash
./gradlew releaseVersion --console=plain
```

Expected result:

- The task creates a release commit.
- The task creates a local release tag.
- The working copy remains clean after the task completes.

After it completes, collect the new version and tag:

```bash
new_version="$(./gradlew -q printVersion | grep -E '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' | tail -n 1)"
new_tag="v${new_version}"
git rev-parse "$new_tag"
git status --short
```

Stop if:

- `new_version` is empty.
- `new_version` contains `-SNAPSHOT`.
- `new_tag` does not exist locally.
- The working copy is dirty.
- The tag already exists on the remote. This command should fail for a new release; if it succeeds, stop:

```bash
git ls-remote --exit-code --tags origin "refs/tags/${new_tag}"
```

If the remote tag exists, stop and report that the release appears to have already been published.

### 3. Collect Commits for Release Notes

Collect commits between the previous release, exclusive, and current `HEAD`, inclusive.

If a previous release tag exists:

```bash
git log "${previous_tag}..HEAD" --no-merges --pretty=format:'%H%x09%s%x09%an'
```

If this is the first release:

```bash
git log --no-merges --pretty=format:'%H%x09%s%x09%an'
```

Also collect summary stats:

```bash
if [[ -n "$previous_tag" ]]; then
  git log "${previous_tag}..HEAD" --no-merges --pretty=format:'%H' | wc -l
  git shortlog -sn "${previous_tag}..HEAD"
  git diff --stat "${previous_tag}..HEAD"
else
  git log --no-merges --pretty=format:'%H' | wc -l
  git shortlog -sn HEAD
  git diff --stat "$(git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD)..HEAD"
fi
```

For a first release, omit the range prefix for commit logs and use all reachable commits.

Commit collection rules:

- Exclude merge commits.
- Exclude bot or infrastructure-only authors from contributor-facing notes where appropriate: `[bot]`, `GitHub`, and `orange-buffalo`.
- Do not include uncategorized commits in the release notes unless they describe user-visible behavior.
- Keep commit hashes available for the final report, but release notes should be readable and not just a raw commit dump.

### 4. Build JReleaser-Style Release Notes

Create the release notes in a temp file:

```bash
notes_file="$(mktemp -t simple-accounting-release-notes.XXXXXX.md)"
```

The notes must follow the current JReleaser-style output used by the project:

```markdown
## What's Changed

### New Features
- Clear user-facing feature description (#123)

### Bug Fixes
- Clear user-facing bug fix description (#124)

### Build & CI
- Build or CI change that matters to maintainers (#125)

### Documentation
- Documentation update (#126)

### Dependency Updates
- Dependency update summary (#127)

### Refactorings
- Refactoring summary only when useful for maintainers (#128)

### Tests
- Test-only change summary only when useful for maintainers (#129)
```

Formatting rules:

- Start with `## What's Changed`.
- Use Markdown headings exactly as shown above.
- Use plain ASCII headings; do not add emoji.
- Omit empty categories.
- Skip merge commits.
- Hide uncategorized commits by default.
- Hide contributor-only lines; this project does not currently use the generated contributors section.
- Prefer pull request references from commit subjects, e.g. `(#2623)`.
- Preserve issue or PR references when already present.
- Rewrite commit subjects into concise release-note entries when needed.
- Use sentence case and no trailing periods unless the entry contains multiple sentences.

Classification rules:

- `feat` commits go under `New Features`.
- `fix` commits go under `Bug Fixes`.
- `build` and `ci` commits go under `Build & CI`.
- `docs` commits go under `Documentation`.
- Dependabot-style `chore: bump ...` commits go under `Dependency Updates`.
- `refactor` commits go under `Refactorings`.
- `test` or `tests` commits go under `Tests`.
- `perf` commits go under `Bug Fixes` if they fix user-visible slowness, otherwise omit unless important.
- `chore` commits are omitted unless they are dependency updates or release-relevant maintenance.

When rewriting entries:

- Remove redundant conventional commit prefixes such as `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore(deps):`.
- Keep the original technical meaning.
- Do not exaggerate impact.
- Do not invent features or fixes not supported by commits.
- If a commit is unclear, omit it rather than guessing.

Before creating the GitHub release, show the generated notes to the user and ask for confirmation. If the user requests changes, edit the temp file and show the updated notes before continuing.

### 5. Push the Release Commit and Tag

Push the release commit first, then the tag:

```bash
git push origin master
git push origin "$new_tag"
```

Stop if either push fails. Do not create the GitHub release if the commit or tag push did not succeed.

### 6. Create the Draft GitHub Release

Create the release in draft state:

```bash
gh release create "$new_tag" \
  --title "$new_tag" \
  --notes-file "$notes_file" \
  --draft \
  --prerelease \
  --latest=false
```

Then fetch the release URL:

```bash
release_url="$(gh release view "$new_tag" --json url --jq .url)"
```

### 7. Find the CI Build

After pushing, find the CI run for the release commit on `master`:

```bash
release_sha="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
ci_url="$(gh run list --workflow 'Continuous Integration' --branch master --commit "$release_sha" --json url --jq '.[0].url' --limit 1)"
```

If the run is not available yet, provide this fallback link:

```bash
repo_url="$(gh repo view --json url --jq .url)"
ci_url="${repo_url}/actions/workflows/ci.yml?query=branch%3Amaster"
```

## Final Report

Report the release result with these fields:

- New version: `vX.Y.Z`
- GitHub draft release: release URL
- Previous release: previous release tag and URL if available
- CI build: CI run URL, or fallback workflow URL if the run is not visible yet
- Commit range: `previous_tag..HEAD`, or `first release` if there was no previous tag
- Commit stats: total non-merge commits, number of included release-note entries, number of omitted uncategorized commits, contributor count
- Docker publishing: state that CI will publish `orangebuffalo/simple-accounting:X.Y.Z` and `latest` when the release-version build on `master` reaches the publish step

Keep the report concise and factual. If any step was skipped or required fallback behavior, include that explicitly.

## Failure Handling

- If GitHub CLI auth fails, stop and tell the user to run `gh auth login`.
- If the branch is not `master`, stop and tell the user releases are only supported from `master`.
- If the working copy is dirty, stop and list the changed files.
- If `releaseVersion` fails, report the Gradle output and do not retry with modified version numbers.
- If the remote tag already exists, stop and report the existing tag.
- If `git push origin master` succeeds but `git push origin "$new_tag"` fails, stop and tell the user the release commit was pushed but the tag was not.
- If GitHub release creation fails after pushing the tag, report the exact `gh` error and provide the `gh release create ...` command for retry.
- Never force-push tags or branches.
- Never delete or recreate a tag unless the user explicitly requests it.
